ðŸ‘€ Computer Vision: Facial Detection &amp; Recognition (Contour Mapping)

- facial-recognition.ipynb

Presenting a discussion of how each of three algorithms from the <b>OpenCV</b> open-source library can detect _and recognize_ faces in Computer Vision at a mathematical level.  

---  

## Contour Mapping

Dependencies:
- opencv-python (for cv2)
- scikit-learn (for sklearn)
- scikit-image (for skimage)
- numpy, matplotlib (basics)

We explore Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Histogram of Gradients (HoG), and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithms with examples and sampling refinement explorations using a few of my own photographs.
